# Assignment-5-The-Maze

This program parses a text file into a 2D Character Array, finds its starting point, and uses recursion to check every possible route of movement until a solution is found, unless there are none.

#STYLE GUIDE:

'S' = Starting Point (there can only be one, and it must have one)

'G' = Goal/Finish (there can only be one)

'#' = Wall. Player cannot pass through this.

'.' = Open space. Where the player may walk.



Also, your maze must have equal line lengths. You can't have the first line be "##S#." and the second line be "##". It won't work. Your maze must be a rectangle.
